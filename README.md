eudc
====

Eudc is an extension that provides functions for character set conversion
between UTF8 and SJIS,  UTF8 and EUC\_JP, including user defined characters.

Eudc was developed by Itagaki Takahiro of NTT as part of the textsearch-ja
project, but maintenance seems to have stopped since around 2012.
This code is taken over and adapted for recent PostgreSQL versions.
